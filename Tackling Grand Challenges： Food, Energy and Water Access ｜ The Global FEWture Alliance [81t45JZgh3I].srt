1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,560
Climate change is negatively impacting food, energy and water security across all corners

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,120
of the globe.

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,200
There are people who are food insecure, there are people who don't have access to clean

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,720
drinking water and there's definitely people who also don't have access to reliable energy.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,760
We're seeing the effects of it in Maryland, we're seeing the effects of it in other areas

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:39,920
of the U.S. and we're also seeing the effects in these countries that we're working with.

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,760
Our UMD Global Stewards program took a group of our fellows to Nepal.

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,480
And we were able to do a hike to this beautiful mountain range in the Himalayas.

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,840
For our students to better understand how, from a very grassroots level, our collaborators

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,320
in Nepal are addressing food and water insecurity.

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,400
Our tour guide, she said to us, if you notice the ground that we're standing on, 20 years

12
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,280
ago this used to be covered in snow and we all looked down and the ground was just, you

13
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,760
know, brown dirt.

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,080
And therefore the water supply that people rely on from the snowmelt is reducing in

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,680
later months of the year.

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,080
Our students were able to observe how our collaborators have established over 200 rainwater

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,360
collection ponds.

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,520
They're allowing Nepali farming communities to store the water during the monsoon season

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,080
and use it for a future harvest.

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,160
That is just a really great example of some of the things that we are trying to do with

21
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,840
our Global Future Alliance project.

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,760
And we're so excited about the partnerships that we're forming, both here in Maryland,

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,280
in Nepal, Israel, and Tanzania.

24
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,880
And I'm so happy that we're going to involve students at almost every level of this project.

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,040
As one of the institutional grants for the Grand Challenges program, our big goal is

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,840
to alleviate food, energy, and water insecurity, protect environmental and global public health,

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,800
and bolster community resilience in a changing climate.

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,920
By putting $30 million towards these Grand Challenges, it's just an indication to us

29
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,520
and to Maryland and to the U.S., the world as a whole, that the University of Maryland

30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,440
is super committed.

31
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,400
And if we want to have a secure future for the next generation, we need to do something

32
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
now.

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,200
We want to be able to have something that's sustainable and in place for years to come.

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,760
I think it's going to be really impactful.
