Climate change is negatively impacting food, energy and water security across all corners

00:12.560 --> 00:18.120
of the globe.

00:18.120 --> 00:22.200
There are people who are food insecure, there are people who don't have access to clean

00:22.200 --> 00:26.720
drinking water and there's definitely people who also don't have access to reliable energy.

00:26.720 --> 00:30.760
We're seeing the effects of it in Maryland, we're seeing the effects of it in other areas

00:30.760 --> 00:39.920
of the U.S. and we're also seeing the effects in these countries that we're working with.

00:39.920 --> 00:44.760
Our UMD Global Stewards program took a group of our fellows to Nepal.

00:44.760 --> 00:49.480
And we were able to do a hike to this beautiful mountain range in the Himalayas.

00:49.480 --> 00:54.840
For our students to better understand how, from a very grassroots level, our collaborators

00:54.840 --> 00:58.320
in Nepal are addressing food and water insecurity.

00:58.320 --> 01:03.400
Our tour guide, she said to us, if you notice the ground that we're standing on, 20 years

01:03.400 --> 01:09.280
ago this used to be covered in snow and we all looked down and the ground was just, you

01:09.280 --> 01:10.760
know, brown dirt.

01:10.760 --> 01:16.080
And therefore the water supply that people rely on from the snowmelt is reducing in

01:16.080 --> 01:18.680
later months of the year.

01:18.680 --> 01:25.080
Our students were able to observe how our collaborators have established over 200 rainwater

01:25.080 --> 01:27.360
collection ponds.

01:27.360 --> 01:32.520
They're allowing Nepali farming communities to store the water during the monsoon season

01:32.520 --> 01:36.080
and use it for a future harvest.

01:36.080 --> 01:40.160
That is just a really great example of some of the things that we are trying to do with

01:40.160 --> 01:41.840
our Global Future Alliance project.

01:41.840 --> 01:46.760
And we're so excited about the partnerships that we're forming, both here in Maryland,

01:46.760 --> 01:49.280
in Nepal, Israel, and Tanzania.

01:49.280 --> 01:54.880
And I'm so happy that we're going to involve students at almost every level of this project.

01:54.880 --> 02:00.040
As one of the institutional grants for the Grand Challenges program, our big goal is

02:00.040 --> 02:05.840
to alleviate food, energy, and water insecurity, protect environmental and global public health,

02:05.840 --> 02:08.800
and bolster community resilience in a changing climate.

02:08.800 --> 02:13.920
By putting $30 million towards these Grand Challenges, it's just an indication to us

02:13.920 --> 02:18.520
and to Maryland and to the U.S., the world as a whole, that the University of Maryland

02:18.520 --> 02:20.440
is super committed.

02:20.440 --> 02:25.400
And if we want to have a secure future for the next generation, we need to do something

02:25.400 --> 02:26.400
now.

02:26.400 --> 02:30.200
We want to be able to have something that's sustainable and in place for years to come.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.760
I think it's going to be really impactful.
