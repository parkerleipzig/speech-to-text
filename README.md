# speech-to-text



Here are my expansive thoughts. 
The whisper AI actually was able make the transcription for the text to speech perfectly it did nto miss a single word in the video I chose. I obviosuly did not pick up on the text that was on the screen in the video because it was based on the audio, but I wonder if that could be the next step of transcription using AI is then using the AI to be able to scan the video for body language or text on the screen to aid those who have sight-issues.
