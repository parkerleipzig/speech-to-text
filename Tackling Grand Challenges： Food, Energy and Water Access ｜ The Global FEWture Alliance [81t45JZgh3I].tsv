0	12560	Climate change is negatively impacting food, energy and water security across all corners
12560	18120	of the globe.
18120	22200	There are people who are food insecure, there are people who don't have access to clean
22200	26720	drinking water and there's definitely people who also don't have access to reliable energy.
26720	30760	We're seeing the effects of it in Maryland, we're seeing the effects of it in other areas
30760	39920	of the U.S. and we're also seeing the effects in these countries that we're working with.
39920	44760	Our UMD Global Stewards program took a group of our fellows to Nepal.
44760	49480	And we were able to do a hike to this beautiful mountain range in the Himalayas.
49480	54840	For our students to better understand how, from a very grassroots level, our collaborators
54840	58320	in Nepal are addressing food and water insecurity.
58320	63400	Our tour guide, she said to us, if you notice the ground that we're standing on, 20 years
63400	69280	ago this used to be covered in snow and we all looked down and the ground was just, you
69280	70760	know, brown dirt.
70760	76080	And therefore the water supply that people rely on from the snowmelt is reducing in
76080	78680	later months of the year.
78680	85080	Our students were able to observe how our collaborators have established over 200 rainwater
85080	87360	collection ponds.
87360	92520	They're allowing Nepali farming communities to store the water during the monsoon season
92520	96080	and use it for a future harvest.
96080	100160	That is just a really great example of some of the things that we are trying to do with
100160	101840	our Global Future Alliance project.
101840	106760	And we're so excited about the partnerships that we're forming, both here in Maryland,
106760	109280	in Nepal, Israel, and Tanzania.
109280	114880	And I'm so happy that we're going to involve students at almost every level of this project.
114880	120040	As one of the institutional grants for the Grand Challenges program, our big goal is
120040	125840	to alleviate food, energy, and water insecurity, protect environmental and global public health,
125840	128800	and bolster community resilience in a changing climate.
128800	133920	By putting $30 million towards these Grand Challenges, it's just an indication to us
133920	138520	and to Maryland and to the U.S., the world as a whole, that the University of Maryland
138520	140440	is super committed.
140440	145400	And if we want to have a secure future for the next generation, we need to do something
145400	146400	now.
146400	150200	We want to be able to have something that's sustainable and in place for years to come.
150200	151760	I think it's going to be really impactful.
